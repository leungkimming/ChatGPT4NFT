# Reasons for Creating this Project
* Most NFTs are used to represent the ownership of artwork. While there are some commercial use cases around in github, such as hotel booking reservation, I am unable to find one that also leverages NFT's image to display booking data in wallets
* Most github projects run on NodeJS using frameworks like ReactJS. I would like to explore using MAUI C# for this project
* Most github projects utilize traditional UI to execution NFT contract functions. As OpenAI's function calling capability becomes more advanced, I want to experiment with evaluating whether ChatGPT can provide a more intuitive man-machine interface
* I plan to implement ChatGPT as razor component alongside traditional MAUI xaml views in the same MAUI C# program, allowing users to compare the two

# Project Goals
* Using NFT as booking reservation and display the booking data as the NFT's graphics in wallets
* A MAUI xaml based App to execute NFT contract functions
* A ChatGPT razor based bot to execute the same NFT contract functions in the same MAUI App
* Complete and working programs in GitHub
